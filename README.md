# COVID 19 Scatterplot App - Zipcode level
This is the code used to create the our interactive zipcode scatterplot. We used the Shiny R package to create a user interface to allow users to explore relationships between a COVID-19 indicator/vaccine indicator and a community indicator by zip coode.

We are posting this code in the case anyone would like to replicate it. It isn't the most efficient, but we certainly welcome any feedback on how to improve this tool. 

Explore the scatterplot in the link in the About section. Thanks for stopping by!
